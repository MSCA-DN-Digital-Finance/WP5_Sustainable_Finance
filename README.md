## Objectives
The WP will focus on combining traditional investment approaches with ESG insights.
	5.1. To answer the main research questions on incorporating ESG considerations into investment process and portfolio construction.
	5.2. To demonstrate the recommender system, green AI credit scoring and ABMs through use cases (SWE, RAI, DEL, INT).
	5.3. To disseminate the knowledge through open source implementations, validated by FRA, ECB, ARC

## Description
WP 5 is led by UNA and supported by all partners. The work is divided into the following tasks:

- Task 5.1. Technical coordination. Monitoring the related IRPs, store the output generated in a location accessible to the entire network.
- Task 5.2. Support the research training for all assigned ESRs and contribute to advanced training content
- Task 5.3. Three Industry Prototypes: To develop and deploy a recommender system for investing in sustainable technologies.
- Task 5.4. 2 Use cases: To propose novel green AI concepts and analyse the economical and practical impact of their deployment.
- Task 5.5. To propose applications of agent-based models to analyse finance growth in a sustainable manner.
- Task 5.6. Disseminate, communicate and exploit the results (Conferences, OS Day, policy paper, three prototypes, use cases).
