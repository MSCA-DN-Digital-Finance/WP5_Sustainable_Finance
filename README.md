# Installation Process

Welcome to our repository! To get started, you'll need to set up GitHub Desktop and configure SSH keys for secure access to the repository.

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is an application that simplifies the interaction with GitHub repositories. It provides a graphical interface to manage your repositories without using command-line tools.

### Steps to Install GitHub Desktop:
1. **Download GitHub Desktop**: Visit [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and download the application for your operating system.
2. **Install the Application**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. **Log in to Your GitHub Account**: Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub credentials.
4. **Clone the Repository**: After logging in, you can clone the repository to your local machine. Go to `File` > `Clone Repository`, and select the repository you want to work on.

## SSH Keys

SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords. Setting up SSH keys will allow you to push and pull changes securely.

### Steps to Set Up SSH Keys:
1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**: First, check if you already have an SSH key. Open a terminal and run `ls -al ~/.ssh`. Look for files named `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`.
2. **Generate a New SSH Key**: If you don't have an SSH key, generate one using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`. Replace "your_email@example.com" with your GitHub email address.
3. **Add Your SSH Key to the SSH-Agent**: Run `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` and then `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
4. **Add SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**: Copy your SSH key to the clipboard with `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (Linux/MacOS) or `clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (Windows). In GitHub, go to `Settings` > `SSH and GPG keys` > `New SSH key`, and paste your key.
